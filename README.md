# Crop-Price-Prediction
<br>
Developed a machine learning model for crop price prediction using Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Decision Tree Regressor. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, with performance evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
<br>
After comparing the models accuracies, the best-performing model was selected, providing accurate insights into crop price trends.
